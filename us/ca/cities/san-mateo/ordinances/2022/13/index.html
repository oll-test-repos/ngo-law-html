                <p>WHEREAS, the California Energy Code and Green Building Standards Code, 2022 Edition, have been released by the State and requires adoption by local jurisdictions; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City of San Mateo's (City) Climate Action Plan recommended the City review local amendments to the California Energy Code and Green Building Standards Code to promote building electrification and electric vehicle adoption; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the California Energy Commission advised local jurisdictions that local amendments requiring electrification are not energy conservation or efficiency standards and thus fall outside of the scope of the California Energy Commission and therefore the City desires to adopt the California Energy Code, 2022 Edition, by reference without local amendment; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City desires to adopt the California Green Building Standards Code, 2022 Edition, by reference with local amendments to include electrification requirements; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the local amendments amend the California Green Building Standards Code to require enhanced electric vehicle charging infrastructure beyond state requirements, require all-electric new construction, and require electric-readiness and electric appliances during residential building remodels; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=HSC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+HSC" title="">California Health and Safety Code</a> Sections <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17922" title="">17922</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958" title="">17958</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958.5" title="">17958.5</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958.7" title="">17958.7</a>, and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=18941.5" title="">18941.5</a> authorizes the City to make local amendments to the California Green Building Standards Code upon express findings that the local amendments are reasonably necessary due to local climatic, geographical, or topographical conditions; and</p>
