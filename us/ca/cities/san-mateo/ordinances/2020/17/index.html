                <p>WHEREAS, on August 19, 2019, the City Council adopted the California Energy Code, 2019 Edition, with local amendments to require solar installation on new nonresidential buildings and encourage building electrification in new single family and duplex homes and buildings with office use; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City Council identified additional local amendments to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions in new construction in alignment with the City's Climate Action Plan; and</p>

                <p>WHEREAS, these local amendments would replace the City's previously adopted reach codes encouraging building electrification in new single family and duplex homes and buildings with office use; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City has completed an analysis and has determined that the requirements of the local amendments to the California Energy Code would provide a positive cost benefit to new construction within the City of San Mateo; and</p>

                <p>Local building regulations having the effect of amending the uniform codes, which were adopted by the City prior to November 23, 1970, were unaffected by the regulations of Sections <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958" title="">17958</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958.5" title="">17958.5</a> and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958.7" title="">17958.7</a> of the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=HSC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+HSC" title="">Health and Safety Code</a>.

                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/ex-a1.">1.</span> This amendment is justified on the basis of a local <strong><u>climatic</u></strong> condition. Failure to address and significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could result in rises in sea level, including in San Francisco Bay, that could put at risk City homes and businesses, public facilities, and Highway 101 (Bayshore Freeway), particularly the mapped Flood Hazard areas of the City. Energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources are key components in reducing GHG emissions, and construction of more energy efficient buildings with dedicated renewable energy installations can help the City of San Mateo reduce its share of the GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. The burning of fossil fuels used in the generation of electric power and heating of buildings contributes to climate change, which could result in rises in sea level, including in San Francisco Bay, that could put at risk City homes and businesses, public facilities, and Highway 101.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/ex-a2.">2.</span> Energy efficiency enhances the public health and welfare by promoting the <strong><u>environmental</u></strong> and economic health of the City through the design, construction, maintenance, operation and deconstruction of buildings and sites by incorporating green practices into all development. The provisions in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code" title="City of San Mateo Municipal Code.">this Chapter</a> are designed to achieve the following goals:</p>
                <p>a) Increase energy efficiency in buildings;</p>
                <p>b) Increase resource conservation;</p>
                <p>c) Provide durable buildings that are efficient and economical to own and operate;</p>
                <p>d) Promote the health and productivity of residents, workers, and visitors to the city;</p>
                <p>e) Recognize and conserve the energy embodied in existing buildings; and</p>
