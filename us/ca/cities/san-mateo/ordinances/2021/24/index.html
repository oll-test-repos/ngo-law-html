                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="1(a)">(a)</span> With regard to the amended childcare development impact fee:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="1(a)(1)">(1)</span> The purpose of the fee is to enhance public welfare and implement the City's General Plan Land Use Policy 4.22, "Childcare and New Construction," by enhancing the City's supply of childcare facilities and mitigating the increased need for childcare facilities created by new commercial and residential development in the City of San Mateo.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="1(a)(2)">(2)</span> The fee will be used to fund childcare facilities in the City of San Mateo to serve the need created by new residential and commercial development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="1(a)(3)">(3)</span> There is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the type of development on which the fee will be imposed, because both commercial and residential development in the City contribute to the need for childcare facilities, as demonstrated in the April 2021 nexus study prepared by Matrix Consulting Group, which is attached as <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/ordinances/2021/22#attachments/ex-a" title="Exhibit A">Exhibit A</a> to the resolution being considered concurrently with this ordinance (the "Childcare Fee Nexus Study").</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="1(a)(5)">(5)</span> There is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and cost of childcare facilities or portions of childcare facilities attributable to commercial and residential development, because the amount of the fee is tied to the demand for childcare facilities generated by the type and square footage of the proposed development, as demonstrated in the Childcare Fee Nexus Study.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="1(b)">(b)</span> With regard to the wastewater capacity charge, the proposed charge does not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing wastewater connections and capacity as demonstrated by the April 2021 nexus study prepared by Bartle Wells, which is attached as <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/ordinances/2021/22#attachments/ex-a" title="Exhibit A">Exhibit B</a> to the resolution being considered concurrently with this ordinance.</p>
