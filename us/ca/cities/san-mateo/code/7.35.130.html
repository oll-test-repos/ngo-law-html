Enforcement Actions under this ordinance are issuance of an administrative citation and assessment of a fine. The City's procedures on imposition of administrative fines are hereby incorporated in their entirety, as modified from time to time, and shall govern the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review of administrative citations issued to enforce this ordinance and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this ordinance, except as otherwise indicated in this ordinance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Other remedies allowed by law may be used, including civil action or prosecution as misdemeanor or infraction. The City or its Designee for Edible Food Recovery may pursue civil actions in the California courts to seek recovery of unpaid administrative citations. The City or its Designee for Edible Food Recovery may choose to delay court action until such time as a sufficiently large number of violations, or cumulative size of violations exist such that court action is a reasonable use of the City's or Designee for Edible Food Recovery's staff and resources.</p>
